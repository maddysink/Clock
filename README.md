This is a digital clock interface I made using Claude.ai for my Innovative Technologies for Design course

# About
I created this light pink digital clock interface using Claude.ai. The interface contains powerful timekeeping features, offering real-time clock display, customizable alarms, and a precise stopwatch. The interface provides intuitive interactions and responsive design. Its minimalist aesthetic and comprehensive functionality make it an ideal solution for contemporary web applications seeking a versatile and visually appealing time management tool.

# Reflection
Throughout this process, I really enjoyed playing around with adding higher levels of functionality to the clock interface.  I experiemented with higher functionality with both the alarm and stopwatch features to see how far I could push this UI, settling on single alarm capabilities with a bell sound and single precise stopwatch capabilities.  When I added features like a stopwatch lap tool or capacity for multiple alarms, the user experience became less efficient and the functions did not work as intended.  Overall, I am really happy with the results and functionality level of this digital clock interface.
